Engineered an IoT automation project built on the ESP32 platform, utilizing the Blynk cloud service for a complete remote control and monitoring solution. The system incorporates an ultrasonic sensor to monitor water levels in a tank, a DHT11 sensor for tracking environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), and a soil moisture sensor to automate a smart garden's watering system via a relay. It also features a servo motor to demonstrate a dynamic actuator response to sensor data and an RGB LED to provide visual feedback. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of sensor integration, cloud-based data visualization, and the application of embedded systems for practical automation solutions.
